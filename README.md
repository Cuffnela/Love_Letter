# Love_Letter

Text based emulator of the card game Love Letter. 

The Love Letter emulator is run entirely from the command line. Once the program is started it will prompt the user to enter “i” if they need more information. Entering an i into the command prompt will open the Love Letter Emulator website that was created for this project. This website contains information on how to interact with the computer, game modes, and the full Love Letter game manual. Users who do not need this information can hit enter to continue. 

In general, the program ignores extraneous inputs during continuation commands. The emulator will then prompt the user to provide their name, select a level of difficulty, and a number of players. After this information is provided it will begin the game. The program then iterates through rounds of Love Letter until a player has the correct number of points to win the game. Each player’s turn is shown on a cleared command clear to reduce noise while playing. The user can exit the program and open the help website during the continuation command at the end of each player’s turn and the end of a round. At the end of a game the user is prompted to play again or exit the program.
